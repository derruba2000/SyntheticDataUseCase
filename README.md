#Travel Insurance Prediction with Synthetic Data Enhancement

##Overview

This project explores the impact of synthetic data on the performance of a machine learning classification model in the context of travel insurance. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle, the project implements a neural network in PyTorch and compares the performance of models trained on original data versus those trained on a mixture of real and synthetic data generated by Mostly AI.

##Objective

To assess the effectiveness of synthetic data in improving the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of a travel insurance purchase prediction model.

##Dataset

The Kaggle Travel Insurance Prediction dataset is used, which contains variables like Age, Employment Type, Annual Income, and more. The original dataset comprises approximately 2,000 records.

##Methodology

-Data Preparation: Original dataset is preprocessed for training.
-Synthetic Data Generation: Mostly AI is used to generate 20,000 synthetic records based on 1,500 original records.
-Model Training: A simple neural network, TravelInsuranceNet, is trained on both the original and the enhanced dataset.
-Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
-Neural Network Architecture
-TravelInsuranceNet is a PyTorch-based neural network with the following structure:

##Input Layer

Two Hidden Layers with ReLU activation
Output Layer with Sigmoid activation

##Results

The model trained on the synthetic dataset demonstrated superior performance across all evaluation metrics compared to the model trained only on original data.

##Usage

Instructions on setting up the environment, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are provided in the respective folders and scripts.

##Requirements

Python 3.x
PyTorch
